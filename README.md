# javascript-assignment

I created a basic HTML web page format to include a Javascript code. 


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting making sure to have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

I used a date form in the HTML document to write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Second, 
Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote a JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
Go to settings into this repo and scroll down to check the website created.
